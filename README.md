**Task#1 - Implement Caesar Cipher**
	
Create a Python program that can encrypt and decrypt 	text using the Caesar Cipher algorithm. Allow user to input a message and a shift value to perform encryption and decryption

**Explanation:**

The Caesar Cipher is one of the simplest and oldest method of encrypting and decrypting messages. This program involves shifting of letters of the alphabets by a fixed number of places.

To cipher a given text we need an integer value which is known as a shift key which indicates the number of positions each letter of the text has been moved down.

For example, if the shift is 3, then the letter A would be replaced by the letter D, B would become E, C would become F, and so on. The alphabet is wrapped around so that after Z, it starts back at A

**Rules for the Caesar Cipher**

	a.Choose a number between 1 and 25. This will be your “shift” value.

	b.Write down the letters of the alphabet in order, from A to Z.

	c.Shift each letter of the alphabet by the “shift” value. 

	d.Encrypt your message by replacing each letter with the corresponding shifted letter

	e.To decrypt the message, simply reverse the process by shifting each letter back by the same amount.
